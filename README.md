#  Air Quality Analysis in Indian Cities (2015–2020)

A data-driven deep dive into air pollution patterns across major Indian cities, using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**. This project explores pollutant trends, seasonal impacts, and actionable insights on air quality.

## Key Features

- Analysis of pollutants like PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂, CO, Benzene, etc.
- City-wise comparisons (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad)
- Seasonal variations and festival/crop-burning impact
- Correlation heatmaps, line charts, and trend detection
- Policy and pollution source interpretation
- Tableau dashboard integration with a visual story

##  How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter or VS Code  
3. View the HTML version if you don’t have Jupyter  
4. Explore the Tableau link for interactive dashboard  
5. Check `mysql_cityclean.sql` for SQL-based insights

##  Future Improvements

- Forecasting AQI using ML models (e.g. ARIMA)
- Real-time data integration (via API)
- Expanding to more cities and years (post-2020)
